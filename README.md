# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Purpose
The overall purpose of this project was to look at data about Cryptocurrencies and use unsupervised machine learning techniques to determine whether or not we could determine if there was a good way to invest based on the data at hand.

## Findings
As you can see with the clusters, it is difficult to see the differences between the four classes. This will make it difficult to invest in any cryptocurrencies in the future based on the variables we have.
